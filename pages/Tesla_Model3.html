Launched in 2017 as Tesla’s more affordable model, the Model 3 was designed to make electric driving accessible to a broader audience without compromising on performance or technology. Its minimalist design features a sleek, aerodynamic exterior, with an interior centered around a large touchscreen that controls almost all vehicle functions. This streamlined interface, combined with over-the-air software updates, allows Tesla to continuously improve the Model 3’s features and performance long after purchase. With a range of options including the Standard Range Plus, Long Range, and Performance models, the Model 3 appeals to a wide variety of drivers, whether they prioritize extended driving range, speed, or value.

					Performance-wise, the Tesla Model 3 offers an impressive combination of power and efficiency. Even the base model can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in around 5 seconds, while the Performance variant achieves this in just 3.1 seconds—rivaling traditional sports cars. The Model 3’s dual-motor all-wheel-drive (on the Long Range and Performance versions) enhances handling and control, making it agile and responsive. Besides performance, the Model 3 has set a new standard in EV safety, receiving top safety ratings and coming equipped with Tesla’s Autopilot, a suite of advanced driver-assistance features. As an all-electric vehicle, the Model 3 supports sustainable driving, offering significant savings on fuel and reduced environmental impact. Its popularity and accessibility have positioned it as one of the best-selling EVs globally, bringing the future of driving into the present.
