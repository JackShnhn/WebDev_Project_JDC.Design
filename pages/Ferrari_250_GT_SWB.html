					The Ferrari 250 GT SWB (Short Wheelbase) is a celebrated classic sports car that embodies Ferrari’s blend of beauty, performance, and racing heritage. Designed in 1959 by Pininfarina and engineered by Ferrari for both road and track use, the 250 GT SWB is renowned for its elegant yet aggressive styling, marked by flowing curves, a compact silhouette, and Ferrari’s iconic prancing horse emblem. It was powered by a 3.0-liter V12 engine, producing up to 280 horsepower, which gave it impressive speed and agility for the time. With its shorter wheelbase compared to earlier models, the SWB was more maneuverable, making it highly competitive on tight, winding circuits. The car could accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in around 6 seconds—a remarkable feat in the 1960s—and reach a top speed of approximately 150 mph.
