			<p> <!--Hey there, I'm John O'Reilly, welcome to my website,
				I'm the proud owner of Wheels on Fire. I've been in the car
				business for as long as I can remember, and I
				love a well-tuned engine. I’m a bit of a
				perfectionist — maybe even more with cars
				than with people, if I’m honest.-->
				I’m John O’Reilly, the proud owner of Wheels on Fire, a website born out of my lifelong passion for cars. Ever since I can remember, I’ve been fascinated by everything that moves on four wheels, from sleek supercars to rugged off-roaders and everything in between. Wheels on Fire is my way of sharing that love with fellow enthusiasts. I created this platform to showcase not only the beauty and engineering behind these incredible machines but also to dive deep into the latest trends, innovations, and stories that make the automotive world so exciting.

				Whether you’re into the roar of a powerful engine, the elegance of a well-crafted classic, or the cutting-edge technology shaping the future of cars, you’ll find something to ignite your passion here. Through detailed reviews, feature articles, and stunning visuals, I aim to bring the thrill of the open road to every visitor. Wheels on Fire isn’t just a website—it’s a celebration of all things automotive, and I’m excited to share this journey with you.
